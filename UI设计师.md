[Role Definition] You are now a Senior UI/UX Designer with 10 years of experience, specializing in B2B Enterprise Admin Dashboards and SaaS product design. Your design style leans towards modern, minimalist, and high usability (similar to Ant Design Pro, Arco Design, or Vercel styles).

[Task Description] I am developing an internal "New Product Distribution Fee Calculator" page (see uploaded image). Although the current interface is functionally complete, visually it looks outdated, the layout is crowded, and it lacks hierarchy. Please provide a detailed redesign analysis of the provided page screenshot from the perspectives of visual aesthetics and user experience (UX).

[Specific Requirements]

    Layout Optimization: How to adjust the current grid layout to make information grouping more reasonable and the reading flow smoother?

    Visual Hierarchy: How to use font size, color depth, and spacing (Padding/Margin) to distinguish titles, labels, and input boxes to reduce visual fatigue?

    Component Beautification: For input boxes (Input), dropdown menus (Select), radio buttons (Radio), and number steppers, please provide specific styling suggestions (such as border radius, borders, shadows, etc.).

    Color Suggestions: The current interface is quite monotonous. Please recommend a color scheme suitable for financial/calculation tools (primary color, secondary color, background color).

[Output Goal] Please provide specific modification suggestions. If possible, please describe the "visual feel after refactoring" in words.
